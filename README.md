# Data-Types
## Aim: To study and implement C++ program structure(Data Types)

## Theory: 
This program demonstrates basic input and output operations in C++ by handling different data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and strings. It begins by prompting the user to input an integer (d), a floating-point number (c), and a character (z), showcasing the use of cin for input and cout for output. Next, the program asks for the user's name using cin, which reads input up to the first whitespace, effectively capturing only the first word if multiple words are entered. The program then outputs the entered name and calculates its length using the size() function, demonstrating basic string manipulation.

### Basic (Primitive) Data Types in C++
These are the most basic types and directly represent data.

**a. Integer Types:**
- int: Typically used for whole numbers (e.g., int a = 5;).
- short: Shorter integer type, usually 2 bytes (e.g., short b = 10;).
- long: Longer integer type, usually at least 4 bytes (e.g., long c = 1000;).
- long long: Even larger integer type, usually at least 8 bytes (e.g., long long d = 100000;).

**b. Floating-Point Types:**
- float: Single-precision floating-point, usually 4 bytes (e.g., float f = 5.5;).
- double: Double-precision floating-point, usually 8 bytes (e.g., double g = 10.5;).
- long double: Extended precision floating-point, typically larger than double.

**c. Character Type:**
- char: Represents a single character, usually 1 byte (e.g., char h = 'A';).

**d. Boolean Type:**
- bool: Represents true or false values (e.g., bool flag = true;).
